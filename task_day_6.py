'''Exercise 1: Sum of Squares
Write a Python program that calculates and prints the sum of the squares of numbers from 1 to 5 using a for loop'''
# sum=0
# for i in range(1,6):
#     result=i**2
#     sum+=result
# print(f"sum of square {sum}")

''' Exercise 2: Countdown
Write a Python program that uses a  while loop to print a countdown from 5 to 1'''
# num=int(input("enter a number:"))
# while num>0:
#     print(num)
#     num-=1
     
'''Exercise 3: Multiplication Table with Nested For Loop
Write a Python program to print the multiplication table for a user-specified number using a nested for loop'''
# num=int(input('enter the number:'))
# for i in range(1):
#      for j in range(1,11):
#          print(f"{num} X {j} = {num*j}")

'''Exercise 4:
Write a Python program that uses a "for" loop to find the sum of all even numbers between 0 and 10 (inclusive)'''
# sum=0
# for i in range(0,11,2):
#     sum+=i
# print(f"sum of all even numbers between 0 and 10 ={sum}")

'''Exercise 5:
 Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to a given numbe'''
# num=int(input('enter a number:'))
# sum=0
# for i in range(1,num+1):
#     sum+=i
# print(sum)


'''Exercise 6:
Display numbers from a list using loop'''
# data=11,2278.6,'juber','nabi'
# for i in data:
#     print(i)

'''Exercise 7:
Display numbers from -10 to -1 using for loop'''
# for i in range(1,11):
#     print(i-11)

'''Exercise 8:
Write a Python program to print the cube of all numbers from 1 to a given 
number'''
# num=int(input("enter a number:"))
# for i in range(1,num+1):
#     print(i**3)
